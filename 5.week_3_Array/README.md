# Practical - Array Operations in C#

## Introduction
This project demonstrates basic array operations in C#, including initializing an array, populating it with values, displaying its contents, adding a new element, and sorting it in descending order.

## Technologies
- C#
- .NET Console Application

## Code Overview

### Step 1: Define an Array
A 10-element integer array is defined.

### Step 2: Populate Array and Display Elements
The array is populated using a `for` loop, then its contents are printed using a `foreach` loop.

### Step 3: Add a New Element
A new element from user input is added to the array.

### Step 4: Display Array in Descending Order
The array is sorted in descending order and displayed.

## Explanation
### Array Initialization
An array is declared with a fixed size of 10.

### Filling the Array
Elements are added to the array in sequence using a `for` loop.

### User Input Addition
The program prompts the user for an additional number to be appended as the 11th element.

### Sorting and Displaying
Finally, the array is sorted in descending order and printed.

## Usage
1. Run the application.
2. Follow prompts to fill in the array and add an 11th number.
3. The program displays the sorted array.

## Output
Example:
```
Array after adding new element and sorting in descending order:
[20, 15, 13, 10, 8, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1]
```
