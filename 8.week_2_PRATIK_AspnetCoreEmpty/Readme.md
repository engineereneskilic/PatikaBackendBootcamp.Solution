# ASP.NET Core MVC Project - Application Structure

This document provides a detailed overview of the **ASP.NET Core MVC Project** structure, explaining the purpose and functionality of key components such as `Controller`, `Action`, `Model`, `View`, `Razor`, and `wwwroot`. It also includes detailed comments for the `Program.cs` file, focusing on methods like `builder.Build()` and `app.Run()`.

## Introduction

ASP.NET Core MVC is a robust framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This document walks through a simple example application and provides detailed explanations of its core components.

---

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were utilized in this project:

- **ASP.NET Core 7.0**: Framework for building modern web applications.
- **C#**: Primary programming language.
- **Razor**: Syntax for embedding server-side logic in HTML views.
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
- **.NET CLI**: Command-line interface for building and running the application.

---

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/aspnet-mvc-project.git
   cd aspnet-mvc-project
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**:
   Use the .NET CLI to restore the required NuGet packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the Application**:
   Compile the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application locally:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   https://localhost:5001
   ```

## Code Explanation

### 1. Builder Creation

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

**Explanation**:
- This line initializes the application builder, providing access to configuration, services, and middleware pipelines.
- The `args` parameter allows the application to process command-line arguments.

---

### 2. Application Build

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();
```

**Explanation**:
- Builds the application pipeline based on the configurations defined in `builder`.
- Returns a `WebApplication` instance that is ready to process HTTP requests.

---

### 3. Routing and Middleware

```csharp
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthorization();
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Environment Check**:
   - Verifies whether the application is running in a development environment.
   - If not, it enables an error handler (`/Home/Error`) and enforces HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

2. **Middleware**:
   - `UseHttpsRedirection`: Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.
   - `UseStaticFiles`: Serves static files (e.g., CSS, JS, images) from the `wwwroot` folder.
   - `UseRouting`: Activates the routing middleware to map incoming requests to appropriate endpoints.
   - `UseAuthorization`: Enforces access control rules defined in the application.

---

### 4. Default Routing Configuration

```csharp
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
```

**Explanation**:
- Sets up a default routing pattern for controller-based endpoints.
  - Default Controller: `Home`
  - Default Action: `Index`
  - Optional Parameter: `id`

---

## Components of ASP.NET Core MVC

### 1. Controllers

- **Definition**: Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses to the client.
- **Example**: `HomeController` with actions like `Index` and `Error`.

---

### 2. Models

- **Definition**: Represent the application's data and business logic.
- **Example**: A `Product` model with properties like `Id`, `Name`, and `Price`.

---

### 3. Views

- **Definition**: Represent the user interface (UI) layer of the application.
- **Example**: A `View` for rendering the `Index` page of the `Home` controller.

---

### 4. Razor

- **Definition**: A syntax for embedding server-side code (C#) into HTML.
- **Example**: Using `@Model.Name` to display a model's property in a view.

---

### 5. wwwroot Folder

- **Definition**: Serves as the root directory for static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images).
- **Purpose**: Ensures separation of server-side code and client-side assets.
